#Problem statement:

1. The goal is to understand the relationship between house features and how these variables affect the house price.
2. Matching of Amazon and Flipkart Products


Libraries & Frameworks Used in Task 1
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Standardscaler (Scaling)
6. Linear Regression
7. Ridge 
8. DecisionTreeRegressor
9. RandomForestRegressor
10. KNeighborsRegressor
11. SVR
12. ExtraTreesRegressor
13. RandomizedSearchCV (Hyperparameter Tuning)


Among all model RandomForestRegressor gives the higest accuracy of 78% and again to improve its accuracy with the help of RandomizedSearchCV hyperparameter tunning is done and the accuracy is now around approx 80% .
